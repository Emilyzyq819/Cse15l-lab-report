1. cd with no argument: output is not an error
There will be no output with this input. By using the cd command, we change the current directory to the directory followed by cd.
Since there is no argument followed by cd in this case, then it will change the current directory to the home directory, 
which is /Users/amily in this case

2. cd with directory: output is not en error
