1. cd with no argument: output is not an error
There will be no output with this input. By using the cd command, we change the current directory to the directory followed by cd.
Since there is no argument followed by cd in this case, then it will change the current directory to the home directory, 
which is /Users/amily in this case. The absolute path to the working directory right before the command was run is /Users/amily

2. cd with a path directory: output is not en error
No output for this command because it simply changes the working directory to the absolute path I entered, which is /Users/amily/Desktop.
The absolute path to the working directory before the command run is /Users/amily

3. cd with a path to a file: output is an error
Because cd is the command for changing the directory. The absolute path to a file is not a directory. Thus, it will result in an erroe message.
